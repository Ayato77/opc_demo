# opc_demo
### A prototype of OPC-Client with NodeJS for single-board computers (like Raspberry Pi)
A OPC Client reads data from OPC-server and analyses data. Results will be transmitted via MQTT.

An extended version of this implementation with WASM is [here](https://github.com/internet-of-production/retrofit-simulation-with-wasm)
